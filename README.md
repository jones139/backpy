# backpy
A small python framework to provide the backbonejs style 'model', 'collection', 'view' concepts for organising data.

I have been playing with backbonejs recently and have grown to like the 'model' and 'collection' concepts that it uses to organise data.   I think it will be useful to be able to organise data in python in a similar way, so I will use this small libary to provide a consistent interface.

Note that this is not an attempt at a complete port of backbonejs to python - just the bits I want to use!
